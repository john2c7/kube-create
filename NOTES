Unmerged fix for crtical tag issue; requires manual fix until 2.4.1
https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/30333

When thinking about a task:
1.) what hosts will this is run on?
2.) can it belong to any current tags or does it need one?
3.) do tasks require variables on the host, inventory vars or both?
4.) can any sub processes be made; parallel tasks?
